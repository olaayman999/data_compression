Heap => complete binary trees => left then right
left(i)=2i+1  right(i)=2i+2  patent(i)= i/2 "round down"
Heap types --min heap =>decinding 
           --max heap =>ascending parent >= children
heapify: the process of creating a heap data structure from a binary tree. It is used to create a Min-Heap or a Max-Heap

if you have a binary tree and want to convert it into arraym fill the array level by level from left to right up to down or use the formulas above, if a parent doesnt have children fill with - -
