the self "like this in c++" variable represents the instance of the object itself. Most object-oriented languages pass this as a hidden parameter to the methods defined on an object; Python does not. You have to declare it explicitly. 

The __init__ method is roughly what represents a constructor in Python, it gets called after memory for the object is allocated


class MyClass(object):
    i = 123
    def __init__(self):
        self.i = 345
     
a = MyClass()
print(a.i) //345
print(MyClass.i) //123


In Python, there is no need for importing external library to read and write files. Python provides an inbuilt function for creating, writing, and reading files.
